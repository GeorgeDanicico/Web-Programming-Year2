      With async, the file gets downloaded asynchronously and then executed as soon as it's downloaded.
      With defer, the file gets downloaded asynchronously, but executed only when the document parsing is completed. With defer, 
      scripts will execute in the same order as they are called. This makes defer the attribute of choice when a script depends on another script. For example, 
      if you're using jQuery as well as other scripts that depend on it, you'd use defer on them (jQuery included), making sure to call jQuery before the dependent scripts.
      A good strategy is to use async when possible, and then defer when async isn't an option.
