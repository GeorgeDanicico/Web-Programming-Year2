          Hello! My name is George Danicico and I am a Computer Science Student at <b>Babes Bolyai University</b>
          in <b>Cluj Napoca, Romania</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          During each semester, we had around 5 different classes, and at each we had several assignments in order to learn by applying
          <br>
          what we were taught during the courses. I am grateful because these homeworks were no easy tasks, and I learnt so much by doing 
          <br>
          a lot of researching in order to find different solutions to optimise an algorithm, to solve an unexpected bug or how to use git
          <br>
          which is a must have skill for every developer nowadays, since its the most used version control system. 
        </p>

        The core concepts that the University taught me, and are also a must have for any kind of programmer are:

        <ul>
          <li>
            <article>
              <h3>Object Oriented Programming</h3>
              <p>We studied the 4 pillars of the OOP, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism, alongside MVC pattern
                <br> and a couple of design patterns like Memento, Observer, Visitor.
              </p>
            </article>
          </li>
          <li>
            <article>
              <h3>Data Structures and Algorithms</h3>
              <p>We studied how are implemented the Abstract Data Types.</p>
            </article>
          </li>
        </ul>
